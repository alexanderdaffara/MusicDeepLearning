The main.py file captures the control flow of our code, from converting MIDI files to
vectorizations, passing them into our two melody LSTMs, to using the trained models
to print these vector represntations as actual MIDI output

To find individual parts of it, specifically the files in which we create and
train the model:
	Our LSTM implementation can be found in MyLSTM.py
	Our Training can be found in trainer.py
